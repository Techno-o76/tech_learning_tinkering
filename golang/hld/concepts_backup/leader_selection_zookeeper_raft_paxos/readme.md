#### Leader Selection Algorithm means:

- What if master fail in master slave architecture ?
- Then we need to select a leader from the slave , that algorithm used for this is called leader selection algorithm.
- Bully and Ring Algorithm â€” designed for different distributed system configuration ( check when require ).

#### Zookeeper

- ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications.
- This is the guy who responsible for selecting leader with some leader selection algorithms and other duties.[ Configuration management, Locks in distributed systems,  Maintain and detect if any server leaves or joins a cluster and store other complex information of a cluster]
- Zookeeper internally use tree like structure like file system, and node is called znode.
- Znodes in ZooKeeper offer the ability to store data and have children, maintain metadata like version and transaction ID, support Access Control Lists (ACL) for permissions, including username/password authentication, and provide notification for any changes.
- zookeeper vs normal key-store. ( why kafka used this instead of any other key-value store)
- quote: "You're comparing the high-level data model of ZooKeeper to other key value stores, but that's not what makes it unique. From a distributed systems standpoint, ZooKeeper is different than many other key value stores (especially Redis) because it is strongly consistent and can tolerate failures while a majority of the cluster is connected. Additionally, while data is held in memory, it's synchronously replicated to a majority of the cluster and backed by disk, so once a write succeeds, it guarantees that write will not be lost (barring a missile strike). This makes ZooKeeper very useful for storing small amounts of mission critical state like configurations."

#### Raft
- 
- This is consensus algorithm [ what ? -> [Link](https://www.notion.so/Distributed-consensus-63b85ade896c4e49ade80ac361690953) ]

#### Paxos
