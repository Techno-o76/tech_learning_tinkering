### Functional Requirement
1. Document collaboration: Multiple users should be able to edit a document simultaneously ( assume it is text based only).
2. Conflict resolution: The system should push the edits done by one user to all the other collaborators. The system should also resolve conflicts between users if theyâ€™re editing the same portion of the document.

### Non-functional Requirement
1. Concurrency: A lot of people are working on the same document 
2. Latency: Different users can be connected to collaborate on the same document. Maintaining low latency is challenging for users connected from different regions.

### Pre-requisites:

#### Operational Transformation 
#### Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)


### High level design
