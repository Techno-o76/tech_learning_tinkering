/*

The pipeline pattern is a series of stages connected by channels, where each stage is a group of goroutines running the same function.

In each stage, the goroutines:

Receive values from upstream via inbound channels.
Perform some function on that data, usually producing new values.
Send values downstream via outbound channels.

Each stage has any number of inbound and outbound channels, except the first and last stages, which have only outbound or inbound channels, respectively. The first stage is sometimes called the source or producer; the last stage is the sink or consumer.


By using a pipeline, we separate the concerns of each stage, which provides numerous benefits such as:

Modify stages independent of one another.
Mix and match how stages are combined independently of modifying the stage.
