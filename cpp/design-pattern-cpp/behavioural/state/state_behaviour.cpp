/*

  The main idea is that, at any given moment, thereâ€™s a finite number of states which a program can be in. 
  Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to
   another instantaneously.  However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states

  -> don't skip any stage
  -> don't done after particular state
  -> if failure don't pass to next
